## Differential Gene Expression Analysis using DESeq2
> - R Scripts: [Getting Data](https://github.com/amenamahdami/Amena_Mahdami_Portfolio.github.io/blob/main/R/getData_airway.r) , [Running Analysis](https://github.com/amenamahdami/Amena_Mahdami_Portfolio.github.io/blob/main/R/DESeq2_workflow_airway.R)

- RNAseq data generated by BE Himes, et al. PLoS One 2014 ([PMID: 24926665](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24926665/) , [GEO: GSE52778](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52778))
- In this project I use RNAseq counts data from smooth muscle cell lines to identify genes that have diffrential gene expression patterns.
- RNAseq performed in human primary Airway Smooth Muscle cell lines which are treated with Dexamethasone (1 ÂµM for 18 hours), which is used for asthma patietnts to reduce inflamation in the airways.
- Objective of project: Characterize Differential Gene Expressions between treated and untreated, to understand the transcriptional changes occuring due to treatment with Dexamethasone.
- Workflow steps:
  1. Read the data and get it in the right format
  2. Create DESeq dataset object
  3. Run the DESeq()
  4. Explore and visualize results

## Heart Disease Prediction
> - [Python Script](https://github.com/amenamahdami/Amena_Mahdami_Portfolio.github.io/blob/main/Python/ML_Project_Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb)

- In this project I use publicly available Heart Disease Dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset), to predict heart disease incident.
- The first part of the project I perform Data Wrangling and Exploration.
- In the second part I use Machine Learning to predict wether a patient is having high risk of heart disease or not.
